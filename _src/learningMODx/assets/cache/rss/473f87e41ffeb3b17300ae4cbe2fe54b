We have corrected Resource Groups issue in MODx Revolution 2.0.4 and uploaded the updated version Revolution 2.0.4-pl2 . If you upgraded to Revolution 2.0.4-pl in the 12 hours since it was released we apologize for the issue but if you may require the use of Resource Groups you will need to update again. As previously mentioned this is not a serious issue if you don&#39;t use Resource Groups in revolution and you may upgrade at your leisure. <br /><br />Thanks,<br />The MODx Team
